# QA_system_SEC_filling_dataset
Build a Financial QA System using SEC Filings data. Employ two pre-trained Language Models (LLMs) like BERT and ELECTRA to compare performance using BLEU scores and latency. Find the code to implement, preprocess, and evaluate the QA system with ease.


# Overview
This project compares two pre-trained language models (LLMs) for Question Answering (QA) on financial reports using the SEC Filings dataset.

# Setup
Clone the Repository: Download the project to your machine.

Install Dependencies: Make sure you have Python and required packages. Create a virtual environment if needed.

SimpleTransformers and WandB: Install SimpleTransformers and create a WandB profile for tracking training.

Download Preprocessed Data: No need to create the dataset; it's already included (you can download them and use them). You can skip those steps.
